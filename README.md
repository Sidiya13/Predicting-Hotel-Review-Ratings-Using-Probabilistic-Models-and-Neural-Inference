# Predicting Hotel Review Ratings with Probabilistic Models & Neural Inference

This project explores hotel-review rating prediction using probabilistic modeling and neural variational inference. A neural Product-of-Experts LDA (ProdLDA) model is combined with a generative classifier to predict TripAdvisor review scores from text. Most details and results are documented in the accompanying PDF report.

## Features
- Neural variational ProdLDA for topic extraction  
- Joint generative model for rating prediction  
- Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) with Pyro  
- Evaluation using MSE, MAE, R², and correlation  
- Topic–rating correlation analysis

## Dataset
TripAdvisor hotel reviews (20,491 samples, ratings 1–5), sourced from  
**Md. Harun-Al-Naser Alam et al. (2016)**.

## Full Documentation
See **MBML_report.pdf** for the complete methodology, experiments, and discussion.
